  abstract: "Software engineering corpora often contain domain-specific concepts and linguistic patterns. Popular text analysis tools are not specially designed to analyze such concepts and patterns. In this paper, we introduce ALPACA, a novel, customizable text analysis framework. The main purpose of ALPACA is to analyze topics and their trends in a text corpus. It allows users to define a topic with a few initial domain-specific keywords and expand it into a much larger set. Every single keyword can be expanded into long clauses to describe topics more precisely. ALPACA extracts those clauses by matching text with linguistic patterns, which are long sequences mixing both specific words and part-of-speech tags frequently appeared in the corpus. ALPACA can detect these patterns directly from pre-processed text We present one example demonstrates the use of ALPACA for text corpora of security reports."

- name: "MARK"
  abstract: "User reviews of mobile apps often contain complaints or suggestions which are valuable for app developers to improve user experience and satisfaction. However, due to the large volume and noisy-nature of those reviews, manually analyzing them for useful opinions is inherently challenging. To address this problem, we propose MARK, a keyword-based framework for semi-automated review analysis. MARK allows an analyst describing his interests in one or some mobile apps by a set of keywords. It then finds and lists the reviews most relevant to those keywords for further analysis. It can also draw the trends over time of those keywords and detect their sudden changes, which might indicate the occurrences of serious issues. To help analysts describe their interests more effectively, MARK can automatically extract keywords from raw reviews and rank them by their associations with negative reviews. In addition, based on a vector-based semantic representation of keywords, MARK can divide a large set of keywords into more cohesive subsets, or suggest keywords similar to the selected ones."

  doi: "http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2884781.2884873"
  abstract: "Mobile app developers rely heavily on standard API frameworks and libraries. However, learning API usages is often challenging due to the fast-changing nature of API frameworks for mobile systems and the insufficiency of API documentation and source code examples. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learn API usages from bytecode of Android mobile apps. Our core contributions include HAPI, a statistical model of API usages and three algorithms to extract method call sequences from apps' bytecode, to train HAPI based on those sequences, and to recommend method calls in code completion using the trained HAPIs. Our empirical evaluation shows that our prototype tool can effectively learn API usages from 200 thousand apps containing 350 million method sequences. It recommends next method calls with top-3 accuracy of 90% and outperforms baseline approaches on average 10-20%."
